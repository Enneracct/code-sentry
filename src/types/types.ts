Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",
